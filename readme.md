My goal for this project is to leverage my machine learning experience and create a DeepFake Detection AI system. I was thinking a lot about the field of Digital Forensics and what would be some of the biggest challenges in the upcoming years. I kept coming back to the conclusion that AI development is moving very rapidly and that development is going to swiftly encroach itself in Digital Forensics. For example, Midjourney, an AI Generative Art company has seemingly pushed the bounds of reality by creating photorealistic fake photos. There are almost at the point where you canâ€™t tell if the images were taken in real life or were created by these AI systems.

# Training Model
The jupyter script detector.ipynb is where the training of the model is done.
```
python3 detector.ipynb
```
The model is trained on the dataset created on Kaggle. 

# Running the Image Detection Model
The jupyter script predict.ipynb is where the image detection is done.
```
python3 predict.ipynb
```
We use the model we had previously trained on the detector.ipynb. We then use the model to predict whether the image is a deepfake or not. I created my own dataset of images to test the model. The dataset is located in the folder my_unages. The images are a mix of real and fake images I took or created. The model is able to detect the fake images with a high degree of accuracy. I used Midjourney to create the fake images.

# Conclusion
- It is possible to detect AI generated images
    - But the pace for AI generation > detection
- Detection for this reason will not be a long-term solution in
regards to Digital Forensics
- Long Term Solution is for AI Image Generation Companies (Midjourney) to create watermarks ingrained
